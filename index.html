    <h2>1) Hamza's story.</h2> 
    <H2>TOPIC = redroom in darkweb</H2>
     <p>my name is hamza and i am 19 years old.<p>
     <h3>DISCLAIMER ! </h3>
     <p>my story is related to darkweb because i access this and i am shocked because this website is not for normal persons and this website is dangerous for you so access at your own risk
<p>It started innocently enough. Just another sleepless night scrolling through random forums and Reddit threads. But this time, I came across a post that piqued my curiosity—“How to access the dark web securely.” The dark web… I’d heard of it, of course. Most people had. It was this shadowy part of the internet that no one really talked about. People said it was filled with everything from encrypted messaging to illegal goods. But as far as I was concerned, it was just a myth—a place where the curious and the reckless went to lose themselves.</p>
<p>But that night, something pushed me to click on the link. It led to a guide on how to set up Tor, the browser used to access the hidden web. It seemed simple enough. Download Tor, use a VPN, and you’d be safely anonymous. It sounded like a rabbit hole, but at the time, I didn’t think much of it. So, I downloaded the browser and, without thinking twice, opened it.
   The moment Tor launched, I was immediately struck by how different it felt. There was no bright homepage or social media recommendations—just a blank, black screen with links that looked like they belonged in a forgotten part of the internet. It was like stepping into a space where no one could trace you, where everything was hidden behind layers of encryption and codes. It was almost like walking into an abandoned building, unsure of what you might find in each room.</p>
   <p>I started browsing cautiously, clicking through random links. There were forums that looked like normal online discussion boards, but the subjects were… off. Cryptic and sometimes disturbing. I came across one forum that seemed to be talking about “alternate realities,” which I assumed was just a niche discussion on VR or gaming. But as I read further, it was clear these weren’t just theoretical conversations. They were talking about illegal hacking, disturbing challenges, and trading personal information like it was currency.
 At first, I told myself it was all just talk, empty threats. But then I saw a link to a marketplace. Curiosity got the best of me, and I clicked it. My screen lit up with listings that seemed like something straight out of a dystopian thriller. There were ads for fake IDs, illegal drugs, hacking tools, and more. But one listing caught my eye—a service offering to track down someone based on minimal personal information. The price was steep, and the description was chilling: "Find anyone. Anywhere. No questions asked."</p>
 <p>It all started on a quiet, rainy evening. I was scrolling through forums as usual, killing time before bed. Most of what I came across was mundane: news stories, cat videos, memes. But then I saw a thread titled, “The Redroom—Is It Real?” The name alone was enough to pull me in, but the thread itself seemed almost too surreal. I’d heard of the so-called “Redroom” before—an urban legend, right? Stories about a hidden, terrifying part of the dark web where live streams of unspeakable horrors were broadcasted, often involving kidnappings, torture, and worse.</p>
<p>The website was empty, just a black screen with a red symbol in the middle that pulsed with a soft, rhythmic glow. Beneath it, there was a single word: Enter. It was simple. Too simple. The kind of thing that makes you hesitate before taking that next step. But my fingers acted before my mind had time to protest. I clicked.

    The page changed, and I was greeted with a countdown timer. Five minutes. The screen went black for a second, then flickered back to life.
    
    There, in the center of a dimly lit room, was a figure. At first, I couldn’t make out any details—just shadows. But slowly, the image sharpened. It was a man, sitting on a chair, his hands bound behind his back. His head hung low, and his face was obscured in darkness. I could hear breathing. </p>
    <p>The countdown continued to tick down, each second adding weight to my chest. A message appeared on the screen, seemingly from nowhere: "What will you do when time runs out?"

        I didn’t know how to answer. I wanted to leave. I wanted to shut the page down and pretend I hadn’t seen anything. But the screen wouldn’t let me. I was locked in place, watching as the timer ticked closer to zero.
        
        Then the text started appearing. Bids. People were placing them in real-time, sending requests, demanding actions. The first message was simple: "Cut him free."
        
        I thought it was a glitch, a trick. But the camera feed shifted as if responding to the bid. The man’s hands, once bound, were now being cut loose. It was happening. My stomach churned, but I couldn’t look away.</p>
<p>The messages came faster now, each one worse than the last. "Make him scream." "No mercy." Each text made my skin crawl. I didn’t understand how people could watch this. How could they participate? But there I was, glued to the screen, horrified by my own fascination.

    The final message appeared as the timer reached zero: "It’s your turn now."
    
    Suddenly, the camera zoomed in on the man’s face, and for the first time, I saw his eyes. There was something in those eyes—something that struck fear deep into my heart. It was as though he was staring directly at me, asking, “Why are you here?”
    
    That’s when I realized what had happened. The Redroom wasn’t just a place to watch pain—it was a trap. A place where you were drawn in, whether you wanted to be or not. It wasn’t about being a passive observer. It wanted you to be a part of it.</p>
    <p>I snapped out of it, slamming my laptop shut, heart pounding, sweat dripping down my back. I couldn’t breathe. I didn’t know if what I’d seen was real or staged, if it was all a sick game or something much darker. All I knew was that I had crossed a line I couldn’t uncross. I had seen too much.

        The nightmares came that night—vivid, twisted dreams of that red room, of the man with the hollow eyes. I could hear the bids echoing in my head, feel the weight of the unseen audience on my shoulders. And every time I closed my eyes, I heard that last message: "It’s your turn now."
        
        I don’t know how long I’ll carry this with me. I never went back to the site, never clicked on another dark web link. But sometimes, in the silence of the night, I wonder if it’s really over. What if the Redroom is still waiting out there? And what if it decides to find me again?
